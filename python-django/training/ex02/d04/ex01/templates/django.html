Django is a high-level, open-source web framework for building dynamic web applications using the Python programming language. It follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern, with its own twist called the model-view-template (MVT) pattern. Django emphasizes the "don't repeat yourself" (DRY) and "explicit is better than implicit" principles, aiming to make web development fast, scalable, and maintainable.
<h1>History of Django:</h1>
Django was created by Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, developers at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in Kansas, USA. It was initially developed in 2003 as an internal tool to manage the newspaper's websites. The framework was later released as an open-source project in July 2005. The name "Django" is a homage to the jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt.
Key milestones in the history of Django include:
    ==> First Public Release (July 2005): Django was released to the public, gaining attention for its clean and pragmatic design. It aimed to simplify the web development process and reduce the amount of boilerplate code required.
    ==> Django Software Foundation (DSF) Formation (2008): The Django Software Foundation was established to maintain Django as an open-source project. It ensures the continued development, support, and promotion of the framework.
    ==> Version 1.0 (September 2008): The release of Django 1.0 marked a significant milestone, indicating stability and maturity. Many developers and organizations started adopting Django for their web projects.
    ==> Community Growth: Over the years, Django has fostered a strong and vibrant community. It has gained popularity for its documentation, which is considered exemplary in the open-source world.
    ==> Regular Releases and Feature Enhancements: Django follows a regular release schedule, introducing new features, improvements, and optimizations. The community actively contributes to the framework's growth.
    ==> Django REST Framework (DRF): While Django itself is focused on web applications, the Django REST Framework, an independent project, extends Django to facilitate the development of RESTful APIs.
    ==> Django Channels: Introduced in later versions, Django Channels extends Django to handle WebSockets and other asynchronous protocols, enabling real-time applications.
